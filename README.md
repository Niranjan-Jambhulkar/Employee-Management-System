An employee management system project is a software application that helps an organization manage and monitor the information and activities of its employees.

**Adding Employees:**
The system allows users to input employee details such as ID, name, salary, Department, Date_of_join, and etc.
These details are then stored in a array.

**Viewing All Employees:**
Users can retrieve a list of all employees currently in the system.
The system displays their names along with other relevant information.

**Viewing Employee Details:**
For a specific employee, users can view additional details such as address, Mob number, email, and etc.
This feature helps managers or HR personnel access relevant information quickly.

**Productivity Tracking:**
Managers can assign productivity scores or metrics to employees and track their performance.

**Modifying Employee Details:**
Users have the ability to edit employee records.
They can update information like name, salary, number, and etc.


The system uses a simple file-based approach to store and manage employee data.
